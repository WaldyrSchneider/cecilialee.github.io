      <description>Philosophy  Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it&amp;rsquo;s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. Markdown&amp;rsquo;s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format for writing for the web.
 Notice You can use CMD + 4 or CMD + R to preview the result.</description>

This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
